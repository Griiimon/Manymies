Trying to run a scene in Godot with as many enemies as possible
=============

![Screenshot Rigidbodies](screenshots/screenshot_rigidbodies.png)


# Features 3 solutions with 1000+ enemies at 60fps

- non-solid soft-separation ( main.tscn )
- non-solid raycast steering ( main_raycast.tscn )
- rigidibodies ( main_rigidbodies.tscn )


It's also possible to combine 1 & 3 so that the enemies don't collide with each other but solidly collide with the level geometry!
